# Seattle Airbnb Dataset Analysis

## Project Motivation
Airbnb is one of the most popular online marketplaces for finding accommodation. They have released a lot of data that can be used for research purposes. This project focuses on analyzing the Airbnb dataset to answer these 3 questions: 
Q1) Describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions.
Q2) What are the busiest time of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike
Q3) Is there a general upward trend to both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
